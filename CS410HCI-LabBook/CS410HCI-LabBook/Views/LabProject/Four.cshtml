    <h4>Guidelines</h4>
    <p>
        Several guidelines specific to multiuser applications are outlined below and contained in their
        respective categories. Along with the description, each guideline contains a respective
        Relative Importance, Strength of Evidence, comments, and references used to source the Strength of
        Evidence variable. Not all guidelines apply to all types of applications and so we created a set of 
        guidelines unique to the application's use cases.

                        Capturing and sending ASL so that it is intelligible is a difficult engineering task.
                        Be sure to investigate which video encoding and transmission technologies can best
                        help you support transferring intelligible ASL through your software.

                        Remote video group conversations can greatly reduce time wasted in long face-to-face
                        meetings. For non-corporate users, group chats are popular ways for remote groups of
                        friends to keep in touch.

                        A study found that a certain company consumes over 300,000 total employee
                        hours per year in meetings to prepare for a larger meeting. Using video chats
                        with text-chat and document sharing support can greatly cut down on long meetings.
                        Text chat is also a ubiquitous feature in collaborative applications, so most
                        users expect to have it because they are accustomed to having it available.

                        Furthermore, users may need to participate in corporate conferences who do
                        not have a data connection. This guideline provides a necessary level of redundancy.

                        Research shows that 40% of web users have experienced online harassment. Of those who have
                        been harassed, 8% have been physically threatened, 8% have been stalked, 22% have been specifically
                        targeted for embarassment, and 27% have been subjected to offensive name-calling. It is important
                        to protect users from online harassment. Giving users the ability to block other users facilitates
                        a safe environment for them.

                        It is vital for users to be able to share their documents across many formats as
                        teams might use different OSes, reside in different countries that use different
                        popular file formats, etc.

                        changes drastically without their input.

                        With simultaneous editing, simply let the last edit win and users can sort out conflicts
                        themselves by using versioning, chat, and permissions features. Last-edit itself can be
                        misleading when considering the technical aspects of simultaneous editing. For example, if
                        user 1 and user 2 are editing document "abc" and user 1 adds "x" to position 0 of "abc" and user
                        2 deletes the "c" from abc (ie, deletes position 2 in a 0-based position system), then we'd
                        expect the result to be "xab". But if we simply send edits without transforming them based on
                        other edits, we'd get the unexpected "xac". Transforming simultaneous edits based on other edits
                        is called Operational Transformation and is recommended here.

                        Collaboration is difficult without an ability to communicate. Allowing users
                        to chat with one-another will facilitate more collaboration. Artists tend view
                        art itself as a dialogue between the artist and the work. Such an artistic dialogue
                        must be shared between artists when collaborating on something.

                        The evidence for this guideline should be self-evident. Art is typically created to be shared
                        and using popular formats facilitates sharing. However, picture formats tend to be easily
                        interchangeable so at least supporting one popularm such as png or jpg format may be enough.

                        Allow drawing owners to grant and deny permissions on their drawings.

                        All, Group, Self are able to edit a drawing, with Group representing a

                        A checkout should be timestamped so other users know how long the item has been checked out and can ascertain
                        when the object will be available for edit. This also prevents indefinitely long checkouts by providing a data
                        field for duration comparison.

                        Users need to work on the most updated version of shared objects so that changes are not
                        lost amongst users. Without immediate updates, users would be unaware of the concurrent changes
                        being made. This would significantly degrade the usability of the application as the integrity
                        of the shared object would be compromised.

                        Each shared object should be able to be restored to any of its previous states. To do this, each check in needs
                        to be associated with a differential between its previous states. Each check in should also store references to
                        which user made the change and at what time. This gives users the ability to find out who, what, when, and why
                        a change was made enhancing the usability of the application.
