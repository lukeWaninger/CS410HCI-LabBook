    <h2>2.4 - Focus Group</h2>
    <p>
        Conduct a focus group with three perspective users to review the draft user interface design.

    <h4>Discussion Overview</h4>
    <p>
        A client participant focus group was performed with three current library users which went very
        well. A mock-up of the application was provided to the group followed by a moderator led discussion.
        Many discussion points came about that will greatly improve the quality of the software. Below is a
        listing of the modifications we are considering along with the discussion points and minutes gathered 
        from our time with the group.

        The discussion was centered around three main questions.
        <ol>
            <li>Is the focus and purpose of the application clear?</li>
            <li>Is anything missing from the map?</li>
            <li>How can we keep the map from becoming cluttered while portraying the necessary information?</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <h4>Resulting Considerations</h4>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                We will need to include a brief introduction of the application. How we do this is going
                to be a challenge. The tool library will be using devices with small screens so showing 
                too much information at any time will force the screen to quickly being cluttered.
            </li>
            <li>
                User-map orientation and scaling must be more clearly depicted. The tool library is surprisingly
                small. Because of this, we initially failed to give scaling much thought. The focus group made it
                clear that we do, in fact, need to give scale and proportion more thought. This concept will be 
                taken forward to the UI build process.
            </li>
            <li>
                Clients were also concerned with having more tool information readily available on the map. 
                This took some brainstorming to decide how to best do this without cluttering the map. We decided
                to include it as a zoom feature. If a user zooms in to a specific section of the map, tools
                associated with that section will be loaded and displayed.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Minutes</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>A brief introduction should be included to explain the map and its purpose.</li>
            <li>Section numbers in the map are confusing.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>From discussion: they may be necessary if people use them to find things in the library.</li>
                ----we will have to check in on that
            </ul>
            <li>Less ambiguous orientation should be included on the map</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Place a door on the map to indicate the entrance more clearly.</li>
                <li>The entrance and exit text should be composed of larger letters and be more clear, perhaps a different color.</li>
                <li>Place street names on the outside of the map so that people can orient themselves on the map.</li>
                <li>Include a "you are here" indication on the map, assuming we are using a kiosk (perhaps only do this for the kiosk).</li>
                <li>Indicate North and South walls.</li>
                <li>
                    Show the building address near the entrance indication on the map.
                    ----discussion: is this necessary? Perhaps less is more.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>Use more accurate scaling for the map so that it more closely depicts the real layout.</li>
            <li>Rename the 'Front Desk' the 'Help Desk'.</li>
            <li>Rename the entrance the 'Door'.</li>
            <li>Less is more for the map details.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Although, would be nice to get more details with closer zoom levels.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Discussion: should we indicate which side of the Help Desk is for Returns and which is for Checkouts?</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Agreement on not indicating: less is more.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>A bit of straying off-topic: we should build a robot to guide users to tools...</li>
            <li>They like the indication of how long until the library closes.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Side discussion: these tool libraries have terrible hours and weird schedules, would be nice to see the schedule too.</li>
                <li>We could show the library weekly schedule when users click/tap/hover on the time icon.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Should tool pictures be included on the map?</li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Some users may not know the tool they want. Can someone find a tool by looking at pictures?
                    ----discussion: probably most tool library users know what they want they just don't know where it is in the library.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>Would be nice for users to be able to search for tools by number</li>
            <li>If the building is not ADA accessible, some indication on the map of that would be nice.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Users may use this at home and it would be nice for them to see if the library is not ADA accessible before going to it.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Users will want to know how many tools are available and their current checkout status; like a book-library.</li>
            <li>Is this going to be embedded in SEPTL website or a standalone application?</li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Discussion: if embedded, we need a link back to the website, if not embedded, no need.
                    ----perhaps we keep it standalone since this is envisioned to only be used from within the library.
                </li>
